# C Programming - Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming exercises from two great textbooks:

- **C How to Program, 9th Edition** by Deitel and Deitel
- **Introduction to Java Programming, 11th Edition** by Daniel Liang (while this book primarily covers Java, the exercises have been adapted for C)

The objective is to strengthen programming skills, explore problem-solving techniques, and deepen understanding of core concepts in C.

## Compiler Used

To ensure reliable and efficient code, the following tools and compilation flags are utilized:
- **Clang (frontend)**
- **MSVC C Compiler (backend)**
- Compilation flags: `-std=c17 -Wall -g --pedantic`
