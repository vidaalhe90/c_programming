# C++ Programming - Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to proposed exercises from the textbook:

- **Introduction to Java Programming, 11th Edition** by Daniel Liang (while this book covers Java, the exercises have been adapted for C++)

The objective is to strengthen programming skills, explore problem-solving techniques, and deepen understanding of core concepts in C++.

## Compiler Used

The following compiler is used:
- **MSVC C Compiler** (`cl.exe` program as backend compiler)
- **Clang++ C++ Compiler** (`clang++.exe` as frontend compiler )
- Code compilation example: `clang++ .\example.cpp -std=c++20 -g --pedantic`
