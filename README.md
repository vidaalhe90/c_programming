# C Programming - Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to proposed exercises from the textbook:

- **Introduction to Java Programming, 11th Edition** by Daniel Liang (while this book covers Java, the exercises have been adapted for C)

The objective is to strengthen programming skills, explore problem-solving techniques, and deepen understanding of core concepts in C.

## Compiler Used

The following compiler is used:
- **MSVC C Compiler** (`cl.exe` program)
- Code compilation example: `cl.exe .\example.c /TC /std:c17 /W4 /permissive- /WX`
